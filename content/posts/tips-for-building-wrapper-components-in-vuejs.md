## Tips for building wrapper components in Vuejs

I remember when I started learning Vuejs. It was love at first sight...a framework that was opinionated in all the ways that fit with my mental model. The template structure and built-in reactivity system with computed props made everything a breeze. When I started building components with it, life was good. It was the perfect idealized development environment.

But, as we all know, we have to work in the real world, with real projects and real problems. Part of that world is collaborating with others, compromising on design decisions and even working with other people's code. Wrapper components play an important, vital part of that collaboration. Essentially, they give you the ability to redefine the interface to already existing components.

Here are a few tips that can help with that.

### Defining the interface

Before we get into how we can utilize wrapper components, it's important to define the interface to components themselves. Don't worry we'll keep this short.
