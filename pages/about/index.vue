    <h2 class='text-center'>Hi. I'm Nathan.</h2>
    <p>
      I love building software tools. It all began about 10 years ago when I started building awful Microsoft
      Access databases at first company (ugh). That got me hooked into coding and soon moved into Windows development (WPF, Winforms, SQL Databases).
    </p>
    <p>
      For about 3 years, I dipped my toes in iOS development and released a budgeting app to the App Store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I prefer to build things for people using Vue.js, Nuxt, Express, Feathersjs and more.
      If you would like me to build something for you, please feel free to contact me via email at <a href='mailto:nathanreyes@me.com'>nathanreyes@me.com</a>.
