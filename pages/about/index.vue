    <h2 class='text-center'>Hi. I'm Nathan.</h2>
    <p>
      I love building software tools. About 10 years ago, I started building awful Microsoft Access databases at my first company (ugh).
      That gateway drug got me hooked into coding and soon moved into Windows development (WPF, Winforms, SQL Databases).
    </p>
    <p>
      For about 3 years, I dipped my toes in iOS development. I released and supported a budgeting app called Ration to the App Store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I prefer to build things for people using Vue.js, Nuxt, Express, Feathersjs and more.
      I'd say I have a heavy frontend focus with a good eye for design using Vue and React, along with enough backend experience to get the job done.
    </p>

      If you would like me to build something for you, please feel free to contact me via email at <a href='mailto:nathanreyes@me.com'>nathanreyes@me.com</a>.
